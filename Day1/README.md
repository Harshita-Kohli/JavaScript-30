# JavaScript-30
Day 1
I have started with this amazing 😍 JavaScript course called "JavaScript-30" where I will be making 30 projects in 30 days using Vanilla JavaScript. Here, I add my everyday learnings.

Day 1: DRUM KIT USING JAVASCRIPT

Day 1 Learnings:
1.I got to know the use of Data Attributes: 
  
  =>src, class, id ,href etc are standard attributes. 
    But we can give our own attributes to data.
    Eg. data-key ="65" is given to the keyboard input A.
    This is a keycode related to A. We can use this data-key in tag to connect the key and the corresponding audio.
    When the key with keycode="65" is pressed, a corresponding audio is played.

2.Adding class name to an element is possible using JavaScript. And not only that, I can remove a class 
  from an element and even toggle between adding and removing class to an element 
    
    =>element.classList.add(‘playing’); 
    
    =>element.classList.remove(‘playing’);
    
    =>element.classList.toggle(‘playing’);

3.There is a huge difference between Transform and Transition property of CSS:
  
  => Transform property allow elements styled with CSS to be transformed in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space.
  
  => whereas Transition allow property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly over a specified duration.

4.I learnt the basics of Arrow Functions 
  
  => Arrow functions are a shortcut of writing the Traditional functions 
  
  => For single parameter functions, the arrow function can be written as: a=>a+100; i.e there is no need to put parentheses around a
  
  => For multiple parameter functions, the arrow function can be written as: (a,b)=>a+b+100; i.e we must put parentheses around a,b
  
  => For no parameter function, the arrow function can be written as: ()=>90+100; i.e we must put parentheses => Fo a named function function bob (a){ , the arrow function can be written as: let bob = a => a + 100; return a + 100; }

5.kbd tag represents the user keyboard input,voice input or any other text input.

6.span is much like div, but div is a block level element, while span is inline

    Let's Detect!!!! Konami Code Detection
<!-- A basic key sequence detection app that logs and stores the keys pressed by the user and then every single time the user keyups, 
    we check if the pressed sequence matches the one we are looking for -->

    <!-- We will be detecting a sequence of keys entered by the user and store it in an array.
     We can then check if the entered sequence matches the secret code that we wanted to match with. If so, we do something funny -->
    <script>
        const pressed = [];
        const secretCode = 'harshita';
        window.addEventListener('keyup',(event)=>{
            pressed.push(event.key);//we push all the keys pressed by the user into the pressed array
            pressed.splice(-secretCode.length-1, pressed.length-secretCode.length);//it splices the extra characters from the starting to keep the length of the pressed array same as length of secretCode
            //here -ve start means it will begin that many elements from the end of the array, then it will delete the extra no. of elements from there
            //extra number of elements = pressed.length-secretCode. Eg: pressed = 'MissHarshita', then, it will be spliced such that Miss is removed from there
            console.log(pressed);
            if(pressed.join('').includes(secretCode))
            {
                cornify_add();
                //console.log('Ding Ding');
            }
        })
